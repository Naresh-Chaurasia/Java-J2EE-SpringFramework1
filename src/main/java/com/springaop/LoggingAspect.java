Advice: The action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. In this code, the logAfter method is an @After adviceâ€”it runs after the matched method executes.

Join Point: A point during the execution of a program, such as a method call or exception handling. Here, each execution of any method in SimpleService is a join point.

Pointcut: An expression that matches join points. In this code, "execution(* com.springaop.SimpleService.*(..))" is the pointcut, matching all methods in SimpleService.
